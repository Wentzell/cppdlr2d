# Discrete Lehmann representation of three-point functions

Main author: [Jason Kaye](https://users.flatironinstitute.org/~jkaye/)

The code in this repository implements the methods described in [D. Kiese, H. U. R. Strand, K. Chen, N. Wentzell, O. Parcollet, J. Kaye, "Discrete Lehmann representation of three-point functions", arXiv:2405.06716 (2024).](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06716) Some modifications/extensions of those ideas are also implemented.

It is a starting point for generalizations of the discrete Lehmann representation beyond the single-particle Green's function. The examples from the preprint above can more or less be generated using this code.

At this stage, this is a research code, and results should not be relied upon. Use at your own risk. Do not expect thorough documentation, though some can be found inside the code.

Please email jkaye@flatironinstitute.org with questions, complaints, or ideas.
